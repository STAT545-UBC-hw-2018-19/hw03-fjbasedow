## STAT545 Homework 3 Repo

This repository contains my homework 3 for STAT545. The goal of this homework was to use dplyr/ggplot2 to manipulate and explore data.

Here is the [md file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-fjbasedow/blob/master/Data%20exploration%20with%20dplyr%20and%20ggplot2%20/hw03-dplyr_and_ggplot2.md).
